With markdown you can use formatting like **bold**, *italics* and even ==highlighting==, not to mention specialised formatting of use to the Christian (such as being able to use the name ^^^LORD^^^).
            
You might be wondering, "Do I really need to learn this 'markdown' notation?" And the answer is no, you don't! Markdown is designed such that you only need to use the parts you want; if all you want to do is write some text with no formatting, you can! But if you ever decide to use italics, you can; if you want to create a link to a particular Bible verse, you can; if you want to highlight something, to come back to later, you can. You can learn just the parts of markdown you need, as you need them, without burdoning yourself with a huge learning endeavour.
        
**Note**: When the full-screen version of the text editor is used there is a toolbar with buttons for many of these formatting options and other markdown features.`,

The caret can be used for superscript text (such as in 21^st^ Century).
        
A "strikethrough" effect can be created by surrounding it with ~~two tilde~~ characters.
        
A hyperlink to another website can be created with square and round brackets; for example, a link to [Google](https://www.google.ca), where the square brackets are the text that will be displayed and the round brackets contain the URL for the link. A URL can also simply be included on its own, and a link will be rendered; e.g. https://www.google.ca will be a link that can be clicked in the formatted output.`,

If desired, the spacing can be made more precise; it won't change the resultant formatted view, but sometimes helps with readability in markdown format:
