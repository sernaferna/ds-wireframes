        content: `This text box accepts a notation called **markdown**, which is a simplified way of adding formatting to text. The text can be "rendered" into a more visual form (via the **Show Preview** button), or simply viewed with simple, text-based formatting in place.

"Standard" markdown provides for formatting like **bold**, *italics* and even ==highlighting==, and the **Devouring Scripture** app adds specialised formatting of use to the Christian (such as being able to use the name ^^^LORD^^^).
            
You might be wondering, "Do I really need to learn this 'markdown' notation?" And the answer is no, you don't! Markdown is designed such that you only need to use the parts you want; if all you want to do is write some text with no formatting, you can! But if you want to include multiple paragraphs you can, without having to think too much about it; and if you ever decide to use italics you can learn the very simple notation for doing so; and if you want to create a link to a particular Bible verse, you can learn the simple notation for that; and if you want to highlight something, to come back to later, you can. You can learn just the parts of markdown you need, as you need them, without burdoning yourself with a huge learning endeavour.
        
**Note**: When the full-screen version of the text editor is used there is a toolbar with buttons for many of these formatting options and other markdown features.`,

        {
          type: PartType.example,
          content: `Text can be made bold by surrounding it with **double asterisks** or __double underlines__. Italics can be applied by surrounding text with *single asterisks* or _single underlines_. Highlighting can be applied by surrounding it with ==two equal signs==.
            
The caret can be used for superscript text (such as in 21^st^ Century).
        
A "strikethrough" effect can be created by surrounding it with ~~two tilde~~ characters.
        
A hyperlink to another website can be created with square and round brackets; for example, a link to [Google](https://www.google.ca), where the square brackets are the text that will be displayed and the round brackets contain the URL for the link. A URL can also simply be included on its own, and a link will be rendered; e.g. https://www.google.ca will be a link that can be clicked in the formatted output.

Finally, while no special markup is needed, it should be noted that some text will be made "prettier" in the formatted view. For example, quotation marks will show up as "smart 'quotation' marks," whereby the simple \`"\` and \`'\` characters become opening and closing quotation marks. Also, **dashes** will be rendered nicely; so those who like to use **m-dashes**---like this---will get nicely formatted dashes, as will those who prefer **n-dashes** -- like this.`,
