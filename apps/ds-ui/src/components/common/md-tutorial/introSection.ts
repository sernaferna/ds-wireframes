Markdown is designed such that you only need to use the parts you want, and ignore the rest.

* If all you want to do is write some text with no formatting, you can do so. No learning required!
* When you want to include multiple paragraphs you can, without having to remember any special notation. Just press *Enter* and keep going!
* If you ever want to use *italics,* it's intuitive to just surround the text with asterisks, like \`*this*\` -- and then add **bold** like \`**this**\`
* If you want to highlight something you can use a similar notation \`==like this==\`. 
* If you want to create a link to a particular Bible verse, you can learn a simple notation for that (such as \`[|Mark 1|]\`), whereby Devouring Scripture will create a link to **Bible Gateway** for you

All of this is mix-and match; you can learn as much or little of markdown as you need without burdoning yourself with a huge learning endeavour.

Best of all, many of these notations are available right from the toolbar; if you ever forget the notation for making text bold, just select the text and click the **B** button, and **Devouring Scripture** will add the notation for you.`,
