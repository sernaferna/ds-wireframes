# Devouring Scripture Wireframes

This project provides wireframes for the **Devouring Scripture** website. Proper coding practices won't necessarily be followed; the intent is not to produce "good" code, just workable HTML that shows what the site could look like.

Leverages the following technologies:

- `react` (and the other obvious stuff like `react-dom` etc.)
- Typescript (just because)
- `bootstrap`
- `react-bootstrap` and `react-bootstrap-icons` (because it's easier), along with `styled-components`
- `redux` and `redux-toolkit` (even though it's all just fake state)

No automated testing, no automated deployments, no automated _anything,_ just the React app.
