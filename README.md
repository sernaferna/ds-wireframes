# Devouring Scripture Wireframes

This project provides wireframes for what the **Devouring Scripture** website can look like. proper coding practices won't _necessarily_ be followed in all cases; the intent is not to produce "good" code, just workable HTML that shows what the project can look like.

Leverages the following technologies:

- `react` (and the other obvious stuff like `react-dom` etc.)
- Typescript (just because)
- `bootstrap`
- `react-bootstrap` and `react-bootstrap-icons` (because it's easier)

No automated testing, no automated deployments, no automated _anything,_ just the React app.
